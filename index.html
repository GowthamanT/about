        <main class="container">

                <h2 class="title">Why design?</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Computer science engineer in college (Graduated
                    <b title="Bachelor of Engineering">B.E</b> in 2021) when
                    designing & building websites for Web development labs,
                    watching a blank page turn into something functional and
                    beautiful gave me happiness and that made me start my
                    <b>career</b> into <b>web development</b>.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Early freelancing reinforced it, I would design and develop
                    websites for hours obsessing over every pixel. I held myself
                    to high standards. It had to look right, feel right, and
                    work right, average wasn't acceptable. But once I started
                    working professionally as a developer, my
                    <b>design side</b> fell asleep. I was implementing designs,
                    not creating them. Still, <b>something felt missing.</b>
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    That curiosity woke up again when I started participating in
                    design review meetings as a senior software engineer. Giving
                    feedback on designs, thinking about how people think and
                    analyzing user flows <b>reignited my drive</b>. I began
                    noticing everything that frustrated me about poor
                    experiences - unclear error messages, inconsistent
                    interfaces, inaccessible features.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Two defining moments cemented my decision to pursue design:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The first was my experience with a banking web
                        application. It threw a vague
                        <b>Try again later</b> error, but inspecting the network
                        tab revealed the real issue - my uploaded document had
                        multiple pages instead of one. That moment reminded me
                        that <b>bad design</b> creates
                        <b>unnecessary frustration</b>, even when the technology
                        works. [<b>P.S</b>: I experienced this multiple times in
                        multiple applications].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second was a single paragraph
                        <b>I read in a book</b>. Most of the times, I pull doors
                        that are meant to be pushed. For years I thought it was
                        my fault until I read that design, not users, creates
                        mistakes. That realization shift struck like a lightning
                        and <b>intrigued</b> me into the <b>design world</b>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I've come to see that design isn't just about pixels on a
                    screen. It's about creating experiences that empower people
                    - making products predictable, accessible, and delightful,
                    even when things go wrong. It's about thinking beyond the
                    digital world, the cities, systems, rules, everything in
                    life is designed by someone. And I want to be one of those
                    people <b>who makes it better</b>.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>My core principles are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Empathy</b> - understanding real needs, not just
                        requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Clarity</b> - creating intuitive, predictable
                        interactions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Accessibility</b> - ensuring everyone can benefit,
                        not just the majority.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Consistency</b> - making experiences seamless across
                        contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Resilience</b>Resilience - designing for graceful
                        failure, not frustration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Design, for me, is about solving real user problems and
                    creating experiences that are smooth, consistent, scalable,
                    and above all, comfortable. As the world evolves, I'll use
                    whatever tools that are necessary - from traditional methods
                    to AI - to craft experiences that delight and empower
                    people.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I don't see design as just a career, I see it as a way to
                    provide value, make lives easier, and
                    <b> leave things better than I found them</b>.

                                    I am an experienced freelancer who knows the
                                    ins and outs of the industry, with firsthand
                                    knowledge of the highs and lows that come
                                    with it. Although I was doing this in my
                                    free time, I've had the fair share of
                                    interesting client interactions, with some
                                    humorous memories to share along the way.
                                    There has been a time where I woke up by
                                    bugs and fixing them was my first thing of
                                    the day.
