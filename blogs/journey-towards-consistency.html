                            I am a person who is living his normal life like any
                            23 year old do. Waking up, doing same routines all
                            over the week days and waiting for the weekend. And
                            in weekend doing nothing, I will just sleep and have
                            a very lazy day. But my dream life is not this. I
                            want to do something meaningful in my life. I am
                            constantly feeling like I am not living up to my
                            potential. I can be more in life. As a web series
                            fan I would like to quote I want to be like Mike
                            Ross or Harvey specter from
                            <b>Suits</b> or Bobby Axelrod from <b>Billions</b>.
                            But what I'm actually doing is getting me nothing
                            like them.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-20">
                            I tried to focus and do things that matter and do
                            stuffs that matter. But what I lack is action.
                            Because every day as I recall my productive time is
                            of average an hour or two (Other than my work
                            timings). On other times I always spending time
                            unproductive or thinking/watching random things. Or
                            searching for motivation and as I get that
                            motivation I again search for more. I don't execute
                            things.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mt-40">
                        <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
                        <p class="mt-20">
                            My mind never aligns for the things I want. It
                            always feels comfortable when watching any
                            motivation videos or any videos that tells
                            somethings or web series or movies from Netflix. I
                            will start doing things that matters but I actually
                            never done it consistently. I have been on the same
                            cycle for long. I severely lack consistency.

                        <p class="mt-20">
                            I strongly believe in the quote that "Mind is the
                            ultimate tool that humans possess". So I want to
                            improve myself and bring consistency & good Mental
                            Stability.
